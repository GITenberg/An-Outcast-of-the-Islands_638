description: "An Outcast of the Islands is the second novel by Joseph Conrad, published\
  \ in 1896, inspired by Conrad's experience as mate of a steamer, the Vidar.\nThe\
  \ novel details the undoing of Peter Willems, a disreputable, immoral man who, on\
  \ the run from a scandal in Makassar, finds refuge in a hidden native village, only\
  \ to betray his benefactors over lust for the tribal chief's daughter. The story\
  \ features Conrad's recurring character Tom Lingard, who also appears in Almayer's\
  \ Folly (1895) and The Rescue (1920), in addition to sharing other characters with\
  \ those novels. It is considered to be underrated as a work of literature for many.\
  \ Conrad romanticizes the jungle environment and its inhabitants in a similar style\
  \ to his \"Heart of Darkness\".\nThis novel was adapted into the film Outcast of\
  \ the Islands in 1951 by director Carol Reed, featuring Trevor Howard as Willems,\
  \ Ralph Richardson as Lingard, Robert Morley, and Wendy Hiller.\nThe work was quoted\
  \ in T. S. Eliot's The Hollow Men ('Life is very long.').\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
